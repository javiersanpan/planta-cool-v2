## Integration with Firebase

To integrate this app with Firebase Realtime database, you will need to use add your firebase GoogleService-info.plist file to ./planta-cool-ios, this file is generated when added an iOS App to Firebase.

The necessary frameworks to integrate firebase with the app have already been installed with cocoapods, if they are not working correctly, run the <code>pod install</code> command to install the dependencies on the project. Make sure you're using the .xcworkspace file and not the .xcodeproj.
